# Group 1 Lesson 4 Homework Report 
--- 
*"Knowledge is Power"*

## Executive Summary 
--- 
Group 1's objective was to deploy, evaluate, and test the functionality of the 04-Tests-Scripts repository. We chose to use a TDD methodology throughout development and testing. That being said, we worked collaboratively to complete the project requirements described in the repository's `README.md`

There are many details to consider when setting up your environment for smart contract development. An awareness of the current state of different testnets and the mechanisms in which you interact with them from API keys to contract interaction can be the difference between a failed initiative and a successful deployment. 

Smart contracts cannot access the ledger directly as the ledger is maintained by miners/validators. In this case, we deployed our ballot on the Ropsten test network using Infura as our gateway to the Ethereum network. 

The rest of this report contains the descriptions of our findings.

## Environment Setup 
--- 
After yarn and friends are successfully installed and runnable. The next thing we did was to update our .env file parameters. Surprisingly for Ropsten via Alchemy are deprecated. Acknowledging this, our options were to switch to Goerli or change to Infura. Infura was chosen to avoid confusion and extra steps needed to find and recieve ETH from faucets. These changes were introduced in commit f6f0820. (https://github.com/Encode-Club-Group-1/04-Tests-Scripts/commit/f6f0820aaa69d512cc278c815fcc8e008363cc88)

Then we copied over our keys using `cp .\.env.example .env`. 

Moving along, We ran `yarn hardhat node` to get wallet addresses and private keyâ€™s. Of special not is the third field parameter in .env 

```

From there, we were able to deploy our contract to the Ropsten test network.

The private key is used to sign transactions. It's importance ought to be underscored as the digital signature is used to verify the sender (`msg.sender`) of a message using the signature itself. Functions that interact with digital signatures such as `ethers.getSigners()` require that these parameters are indeed present.   

We really did not need to worry about the fact that hardhat generates shared wallets for this project. But, it should also be noted that using the wallets offered via hardhat are *never* safe to use in production and can result in loss of funds.
